Data type stuff




IMAGE

	/**********/
	/* Pixels */
	/**********/
	
	We should be able to see data of an image (and possibly a movie) pixel by pixel. Should we have a 2D array of pixels? It could be accessed like this:
		image rocket = "zoom.jpg";
		color c = rocket[33,58].color;

	This kind of suggests another class of Pixels though which sucks. But matrix representation of visual media is important to consider.


DO WE WANT NULL???
