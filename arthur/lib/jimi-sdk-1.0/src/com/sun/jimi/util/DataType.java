/**
 * This class provides a data type identification in the form of a string.
 * Clients of this class are responsible for mapping that identifier
 * string to something useful.<p>
 *
 * If the getID(InputStream is) method is used then the client is
 * responsible for passing an input stream which can be reset to
 * restore the data consumed by this class in an attempt to identify
 * the specified source.<p>
 *
 * Currently this class currently only supports type identification via
 * filename extension.<p>
 *			  
 * PROJECTED OPERATION IS BELOW
 *
 * This class retreives data from the designated source and checks
 * for matches against expressions stored in a configuration file to
 * locate the file ID. See external specification for format of the file
 * and field contents etc.<p>
 *
 * The configuration file is an ascii text file which is currently maintained
 * by editing the file with a text editor. This will change in the future to
 * allow applications to register there own fileTypes and expressions for
 * specific clients.<p>
